""" Multicast DNS Service Discovery for Python, v0.12
    Copyright (C) 2003, Paul Scott-Murphy

    This module provides a framework for the use of DNS Service Discovery
    using IP multicast.  It has been tested against the JRendezvous
    implementation from <a href="http://strangeberry.com">StrangeBerry</a>,
    and against the mDNSResponder from Mac OS X 10.3.8.
